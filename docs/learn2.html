        <p>Tutorial: Alignment of Short Reads with UGENE In this block we will perform short reads alignment using UGENE. One of the applications of
            alignment is the gene mapping. We will do genomic mapping of a simulated dataset generated from E.coli reference genome (NC_010473). The
            dataset consists of 100,000 paired-end reads of size 50 bp. Starting <a href="/alignment-of-short-reads/">more&#8230;</a>
