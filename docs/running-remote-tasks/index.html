    <p> Here we discuss the most popular topics introduced by our users and show the helpful ways of using UGENE, a free cross-platform genome analysis suite.
    </p>
    <p>
        Distributed computing is a good thing. It helps to run large tasks times faster. In UGENE, you can run remote tasks and perform distributed computing of
        the appropriate tasks. Back in the podcast we&#39;ve mentioned possibility of remote MUSCLE run. Let&#39;s make it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Open a CLUSTAL file, containing an alignment. We can choose this file <i>"COI.aln"</i> from UGENE sample files. Click anywhere at
        the alignment editor view and activate &bdquo;Align&ldquo;, &bdquo;Align with MUSCLE&ldquo;. We&#39;re interested in pressing &bdquo;Remote runâ€¦&ldquo;
        button now.
    </p>
    <p>
        The appeared dialog box suggests us to specify the remote machines to run our task on. We have options to add specific remote machine ID by pressing
        &bdquo;Add&ldquo;, scan local network for UGENE-running machines or use UGENE public machines. I have a few machines from my network that run UGENE
        here, so let&#39;s scan the network.
        In the appeared dialog box we can choose a protocol to scan machines with and see the machines available by that protocol. We choose machines
        by checking their radio buttons. When done, press &bdquo;Add selected&ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
        The selected machine is represented with a table row. We can unfold it by pressing the &bdquo;+&ldquo;-icon from the first table column to look at the
        available remote tasks. The machine supports Muscle3, and that&#39;s what we need. Let&#39;s choose it by checking its radio button and finally run the
        align.
    </p>
    <p>
        The status line indicates that our task is running. When it&#39;s done, a report becomes available that&#39;s represented at the right part of the
        status line. Double click opens it. We see, that the &bdquo;Muscle align on remote machine&ldquo; task is finished at 100%. The alignment is done.
